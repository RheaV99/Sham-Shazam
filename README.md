The goal of our project is to create a location based music recognition service, similar
to Shazam, but using open systems. This will take audio input, identify the song
playing and record this information along with the location, using GPS, to a database.
We plan on making this as a progressive web application using react which will take
audio input via the device and will then use an existing API service such as Aud-D to
identify the song and record this information plus the location via GPS to a database.
We also plan on including the development of neural network technologies for
reducing the noise on the recordings to improve the ability of the system to recognise
music which is playing in noisy environments.
Our app will allow the user to find out information about the song and have a record of
the songs that have been recorded. This can be useful for a wide variety of users that
enjoy music.
Our project is also targeted towards music artists and people who play music in public
areas, such as shop owners, as our project helps to figure out what music is playing in
public spaces and stores it in a database so that it could aid businesses in paying
royalties to the appropriate artist and record label in the appropriate time frame.
